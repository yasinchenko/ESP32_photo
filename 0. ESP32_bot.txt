# 3. Motor Driver Board Introduction

  **(1). Introduction**

The motor driver board is designed for the ESP32-CAM video car, which boasts an automatic download circuit to download code for the ESP32-CAM via a USB cable. It also integrates a battery charging function and we can charge via a USB cable. What's more, four LEDs are used as power display. 

Discharge while charging is not supported. When the charging IC detects that there is a load consuming power, it will interrupt the charging function and change it to discharging function.  Thus if we need to charge, we only need to turn the switch OFF and plug in the USB cable.

We use the IIC method(use two pins) to control the motor. The specific principle is that we write code to receive IIC signal on a STC8G1K08 control chip of the motor driver board, then the ESP32-CAM sends the IIC signal to enable the two chips to communicate with the IIC. Thus the ESP32-CAM is capable of controlling the chip to output PWM signal to the HR8833 motor driver IC via the IIC communication in a way that controls the motor.

<p style="color:red">Note：ESP32-CAM can't use the SD card function when used together with the motor driver board due to pin conflict.</p>

# 5. Control the LEDs of the Car

**(1).Description**

The video car is equipped with two 10mm headlights. We will control the two LEDs with one pin, so that the status of the two LEDs is synchronized. No wiring is required, just plug the ESP32-CAM development board into the motor driver board of the video car.

**(2).Working Principle**

As can be seen from the schematic diagram, we connect the LED directly to the VCC of  5V, then we will use the triode Q1 as a switch. When the pin 1 of Q1 (IO12 pin of the ESP32-CAM) outputs high level, the pin 3 and pin 2 of Q1 are conducting (when the output is low level, pins 3 and 2 are not conducting), the VCC of 5V passes through the LED to the R13 current limiting resistor and then goes from pin 3 to pin 2 to GND to form a loop. (R15 is a current-limiting resistor, and R12 is a pull-down resistor to prevent the LED from being unstable when IO12 is in a high-impedance state).

![image-20240125100853016](./media/image-20240125100853016.png)

**(3).Code**

Tap it to download the code：[Codes](./Codes.zip)

```c

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(LED,HIGH);   //IO12 pin outputs high level
  delay(1000);              //delay 1s
  digitalWrite(LED,LOW);    //IO12 pin outputs low level
  delay(1000);              //delay 1s
}
```

**(4).Test Result**

After the code is uploaded successfully, the LEDs light up for 1s and turn off for 1s.

# 6. Control the Brightness of LEDs

**(1).Description**

A “breathing LED” is a phenomenon where an LED's brightness smoothly changes from dark to bright and back to dark, continuing to do so and giving the illusion of an LED“breathing. Thus how to control LED’s brightness? We need to use the PWM of ESP32 to achieve it.

![image-20240113080822039](./media/image-20240113080822039.png)

**(2). Working Principle of PWM**

**Analog & Digital：**

Analog signal are continuous signals in both time and value. On the contrary, a digital signal or discrete time signal is a time series consisting of a sequence of quantities. Most signals in life are analog signals. A familiar example of an analog signal would be how the temperature throughout the day continuously changes and could not change instantaneously from 0℃ to 10℃.

However, digital signals can instantaneously change in value. This change is expressed in numbers as 1 and 0 (the basis of binary code). Their differences can be seen more easily when compared, as shown below:

![img](./media/wps1.jpg)

**PWM：**

PWM, Pulse-Width Modulation, is a very effective method for using digital signals to control analog circuits. Common processors cannot directly output analog signals. PWM technology makes it very convenient to achieve this conversion (translation of digital to analog signals). 

PWM technology uses digital pins to send certain frequencies of square waves, that is, the output of high levels and low levels, which alternately last for a while. The total time for each set of high levels and low levels is generally fixed, which is called the period (Note: the reciprocal of the period is frequency). The time of high level outputs is generally called “pulse width”, and the duty cycle is the percentage of pulse width (PW) to the total period (T) of the waveform.

The longer the output of high levels last, the longer the duty cycle and the higher the corresponding voltage in the analog signal will be. The following figures show how the analog signal voltages vary between 0V-3.3V(high level is 3.3V) corresponding to the pulse width 0%-100%:



![imgimg](./media/wps2.jpg)

The longer the PWM duty cycle is, the higher the output power will be. Therefore, we can use PWM to control the brightness of an LED or the speed of DC motor and so on. It is evident from the above that PWM is not real analog, and the effective value of the voltage is equivalent to the corresponding analog. Then we can control the output power of the LED and other output modules to achieve different effects. 

**ESP32 and PWM**

On ESP32, the LEDC(PWM) controller has 16 separate channels, each of which can independently control frequency, duty cycle, and even accuracy. Unlike traditional PWM pins, the PWM output pins of ESP32 are configurable, with one or more PWM output pins per channel. The relationship between the maximum frequency and bit precision is shown in the following formula. 

![img](./media/wps3.jpg)

The maximum value of bit is 31. For example, generate a PWM with an 8-bit precision (28=256. Values range from 0 to 255) with a maximum frequency of 80,000,000/255 = 312,500Hz.）

**Method for Arduino output PWM：**

**Method 1：** 

​	Use `analogicWrite (Pin, value)` The function can directly output PWM.

​	Pin：Pin for outputting PWM

​	value：Output PWM value

  https://www.keyestudio.com
*/
#define LED 12  //Define LED as 12 pin
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(LED,OUTPUT); //Set pin mode to output
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  for (int i = 0; i < 255; i++) {  //for loop, control i to increase from 0 to 255
    analogWrite(LED, i);               //output pwm
    delay(10);
  }
  for (int i = 255; i > 1; i--) {  //for loop, control i to decrease from 255 to 0
    analogWrite(LED, i);               //output pwm
    delay(10);
  }
}

```

**(4).Test Result**

After the code is uploaded successfully, the LEDs slowly turn from dark to bright and then from bright to dark.

**(5).Code Explanation**

```c
  for (int i = 0; i < 255; i++) {  //for loop, control i to increase from 0 to 255
    analogWrite(LED, i);                //output pwm
    delay(10);
  }
```

`for(int i = 0; i < 255; i++)`：`int i = 0` in the bracket is the starting value of the loop, `i < 255` is the loop condition. When the loop condition is not met, the for loop will exit. `i++` will add 1 to the value of i every time it loops. The loop will exit when the value of i reaches 256.

`for (int i = 255; i > 1; i--)`：The loop is the opposite of the above, the starting value is 255, `i--` decreases the value of i by 1 every time it loops, and exits the loop when the value of i is 0.

# 7. Motor Drive Mode

**(1).Description**

We use IIC to control the motor driver, thus saving several pins for expansion.

**(2).Working Principle**

ESP32-CAM serves as the host and STC8G1K08 serves as the slave for IIC communication. The ESP32-CAM controls STC8G1K08 to output PWM signals to DR8833 via IIC in a way that controls the rotation of the motor. If you are interested in the principles of IIC communication, you can search for relevant information online. We have encapsulated it here and you can use the function directly.

**Functions in SetMotor.h library：**

`i2c_init();`Initialize the IIC function. When using a motor driver, you must add this function.

`Car_forward(value1, value2);`Car forward function, value1 is the forward speed value of the right wheel, value2 is the forward speed value of the left wheel.

`Car_backwards(value1, value2);`Car retreat function, value1 is the speed value of the right wheel retreating, value2 is the speed value of the left wheel retreating.

`Car_left(value1, value2);`Car left turn function, value1 is the forward speed value of the right wheel, value2 is the backward speed value of the left wheel.

`Car_right(value1, value2);`Car right turn function, value1 is the backward speed value of the right wheel, value2 is the forward speed value of the left wheel.

`Car_stop();`Car stop function.

  delay(2000);
  Car_left(100, 100);  //The car turns left
  delay(2000);
  Car_right(100, 100);  //The car turns right
  delay(2000);
  Car_stop();  //The car stops
  delay(2000);
}
```

**(4).Test Result**

After the code is uploaded successfully, the car moves forward for 2s, goes back for 2s, turns left for 2s, turns right for 2s, then stops for 2s.

# 8. Video Smart Car

**(1).Description**

The ESP32-CAM development board boasts a camera and wifi function. Video signals are transmitted to the control end (mobile phone or computer) through wifi, and the control signals from the control end are also transmitted to ESP32-CAM through wifi. The APP control method is abandoned and enter the IP printed by the serial port of the car on the browser of the control end, then we are able to enter the control page.

**(2).Function**

The ESP32-CAM development board boasts Wi-Fi (2.4G) and Bluetooth (4.2) functions, which can be easily connected to the Wi-Fi network and communicate with other devices in the network. You can use the ESP32-CAM to display the webpage in the browser.

**arduino IDE provides \<WiFi.h\>library files，Wi-Fi library supports configuration and monitoring of ESP32 Wi-Fi networking functions.**

- Base station mode (STA mode or Wi-Fi client mode), when ESP32 is connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot (AP).
- AP mode (Soft-AP mode or Wi-Fi hotspot mode), when other Wi-Fi devices are connected to the ESP32.
- AP-STA coexistence mode (ESP32 is both a Wi-Fi hotspot and a Wi-Fi device connected to another Wi-Fi hotspot).
- The above modes support multiple security modes (WPA, WPA2 and WEP).
- Search Wi-Fi hotspots (including active scanning and passive scanning).
- Support promiscuous mode monitoring of IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi packets.

**Operation animation example：**

<p style="color:red">A problem that often occurs when using the web version is that long-pressing the browser page will enter the recognition mode, so how should we solve it? If you need to move forward, first click the forward button and then press the left or right turn button while holding the forward button, so that you will not enter the recognition mode.</p>

**(4).Test Result**

After uploading the code, the headlight on the car flashes and then turns on, which means that the network is successfully turned on. Turn on the mobile phone's wifi and look for a wifi named "keyes1" to connect to, the password is "88888888", after the connection is successful, open the mobile browser and enter IP: 192.168.4.1 to enter the control page.

You can modify the ssid and password according to your own preferences.

```c
const char* ssid = "keyes1";        //AP Name or Router SSID
const char* password = "88888888";  //Password. Leave blank for open network.

# 9. Gameplay Expansion Ideas

1. The LEGO holes on both sides of the car's driver board can be used to assemble LEGO. 

   ![eca9b65c4da479c8be039ea1308a9ed7](./media/eca9b65c4da479c8be039ea1308a9ed7.png)

2. There are four GPIO ports for expanding sensors and  modules.

![image-20240218132219456](./media/image-20240218132219456.png)

# 10. Common Problems

1. Select the wrong development board. Many ESP32 series are compatible but the internal library files are different. For example, when uploading the video car code, the development board selects "**ESP32 Dev Module"**, then you can upload the code successfully, but the code does not run. So for our video car, we must choose "**AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**".

2. Turn on the switch and the battery indicator light does not light up. It may be that the battery is out of power. Just charge it.

3. If you cannot see the serial port in the Arduino IDE after plugging in the USB, the first step is to check whether the CH340 driver is installed, the second step is to check whether the power switch of the car is turned on.

4. The IP address cannot be entered: the first step is to check whether it is connected to the correct wifi. If AP=1, then the mobile phone or tablet needs to be connected to the wifi of esp32-cam; if AP=0, the wifi connected to esp32-cam must be connected, which must be consistent with the wifi connected to the mobile phone or tablet (you can also open a hotspot on the mobile phone or tablet to connect it to the esp32-cam). 

Note: When AP=1, the IP address is "192.168.4.1". When AP=0, you need to obtain the IP address through the serial port, open the serial port of the arduino IDE and click reset button, then wait for the connection to wifi to get the IP.
